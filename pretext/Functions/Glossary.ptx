      <title>chatterbox function</title>
      <p>A function which interacts with the user (using <c>input</c> or <c>print</c>) when
                            it should not. Silent functions that just convert their input arguments into
                            their output results are usually the most useful ones.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>composition (of functions)</title>
      <p>Calling one function from within the body of another, or using the
                            return value of one function as an argument to the call of another.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>dead code</title>
      <p>Part of a program that can never be executed, often because it appears
                            after a <c>return</c> statement.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>fruitful function</title>
      <p>A function that yields a return value instead of <c>None</c>.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>incremental development</title>
      <p>A program development plan intended to simplify debugging by adding and
                            testing only a small amount of code at a time.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>None</title>
      <p>A special Python value. One use in Python is that it is returned
                            by functions that do not execute a return statement with a return argument.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>return value</title>
      <p>The value provided as the result of a function call.</p>
    </gi>

      <title>scaffolding</title>
      <p>Code that is used during program development to assist with development
                            and debugging. The unit test code that we added in this chapter are
                            examples of scaffolding.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>temporary variable</title>
      <p>A variable used to store an intermediate value in a complex
                            calculation.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>deterministic</title>
      <p>A process that is repeatable and predictable.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>documentation</title>
      <p>A place where you can go to get detailed information about aspects of your
                            programming language.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>module</title>
      <p>A file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in
                            other Python programs. The contents of a module are made available to
                            the other program by using the <em>import</em> statement.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>pseudo -random number</title>
      <p>A number that is not genuinely random but is instead created algorithmically.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>random number</title>
      <p>A number that is generated in such a way as to exhibit statistical randomness.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>random number generator</title>
      <p>A function that will provide you with random numbers, usually between 0 and 1.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>standard library</title>
      <p>A collection of modules that are part of the normal installation of Python.</p>
