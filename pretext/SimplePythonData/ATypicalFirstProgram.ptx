  <title>A Typical First Program</title>
  <p>Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called <em>Hello,
                World!</em> because all it does is display the words, Hello, World!  In Python, the source code
            looks like this.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
print("Hello, World!")
</input>
  </program>

  <p>Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the simplicity of
    the Hello, World! program. By this standard, Python does about as well as
    possible.</p>

  <p>This is an example of using the <term>print function</term>, which doesn't actually
            print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the phrase:</p>
  <pre>Hello, World!</pre>

  <p>The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the value.
    They don't appear in the result.</p>
  <p>In the context of this book, we will use the print function to perform the output step in the algorithms we work with. </p><p>Here is the example in activecode.  Give it a try!</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_aTypicalFirstProgram_1" label="ac_aTypicalFirstProgram_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print("Hello, World!")
        </input>
  </program>
 
  
  <p>

<p>

  The <c>print("Hello, World!")</c> statement in Python outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. 
  The quotation marks (" ") within the code define the start and end of a string value, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. 
  The quotation marks tell Python that everything inside them should be treated as text, not code.

  When we run this code, Python displays only the text content between the quotation marks, so the quotes themselves aren't part of the output. 
  This is why the result displayed on the screen is simply: <c>Hello, World!</c> 


</p>
<p>
  In Python, and in most programming languages, a string is a data type used to represent text, such as words, sentences, or any <term>sequence</term> of characters. 
  Strings are created by enclosing text within quotation marks, either single (' ') or double (" "). For example:
  <program language="python">
    <input>
      "Hello, World!"      # Using double quotes
      'Alice'             # Using single quotes
</input>
  </program>

</p>
<p>
Strings are versatile and widely used, from displaying messages to handling user input. 
  Python allows flexibility in defining strings, so single or double quotes can be used interchangeably. 
  This flexibility is especially helpful if your string contains an apostrophe or quotation marks, as in 
  "It's a beautiful day" or 'She said, "Hello!"'.

  Here is the example in activecode. Give it a try!
  <program xml:id="ac_aTypicalFirstProgram_2" label="ac_aTypicalFirstProgram_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      
      print("It's a beautiful day!")  # text includes an apostrophe

      print('She said, "Hello!"') # text includes double quotes
      </input>
  </program>
</p>

                    Within the Python programming language, the print function has nothing to do with the printer.

                    Yes, the print function is used to display the value of the thing being printed.

        <feedback>
                    The format of the information is called its font and has nothing to do with the print function.

                    That would be a different function.
