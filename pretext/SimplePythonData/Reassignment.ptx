  <title>Modifying Variables</title>
  <introduction>
  <!--<video xml:id="reassignmentvid" youtube="G86akhNFHZA" width="auto"/>-->
  <p>As we have mentioned previously, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the
            same variable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value
            (and stop referring to the old value).</p>
  <program xml:id="ch2_sec10_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
bruce = 5
print(bruce)
bruce = 7
print(bruce)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>The first time <c>bruce</c> is
            printed, its value is 5, and the second time, its value is 7.  The assignment statement changes
            the value (the object) that <c>bruce</c> refers to.</p>
  <p>Here is what <term>reassignment</term> looks like in a reference diagram:</p>
  <image source="SimplePythonData/Figures/reassign1.png" width="50%" alt="reassignment"/>
  <p>It is important to note that in mathematics, a statement of equality is always true.  If <c>a is equal to b</c>
            now, then <c>a will always equal to b</c>. In Python, an assignment statement can make
            two variables refer to the same object and therefore have the same value.  They appear to be equal.  However, because of the possibility of reassignment,
            they don't have to stay that way:</p>
  <program xml:id="ch2_sec10_p2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
a = 5
b = a    # after executing this line, a and b are now equal
print(a, b)
a = 3    # after executing this line, a and b are no longer equal
print(a, b)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>Line 4 changes the value of <c>a</c> but does not change the value of
    <c>b</c>, so they are no longer equal. We will have much more to say about equality in a later chapter.</p>
        </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="simple-python-data_developing-your-mental-model-of-how-python-evaluates">
    <title>Developing your mental model of How Python Evaluates</title>
    <p>Its important to start to develop a good mental model of the steps Python takes when evaluating an assignment statement.  In an assignment statement Python first evaluates the code on the right hand side of the assignment operator.  It then gives a name to whatever that is.  The (very short) visualization below shows what is happening.</p>
    <exercise runestone="se_reassign"/>
    <p>In the first statement <title_reference>a = 5</title_reference> the literal number 5 evaluates to 5, and is given the name <title_reference>a</title_reference>.  In the second statement, the variable <title_reference>a</title_reference> evaluates to 5 and so 5 now ends up with a second name <title_reference>b</title_reference>.
    </p>
    <note>
      <p>In some programming languages, a different
                    symbol is used for assignment, such as <c>&lt;-</c> or <c>:=</c>.  The intent is
                    that this will help to avoid confusion.  Python
                    chose to use the tokens <c>=</c> for assignment, and <c>==</c> for equality.  This is a popular
                    choice also found in languages like C, C++, Java, and C#.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>After the following statements, what are the values of x and y?</p>
        <program language="python">
          <input>
x = 15
y = x
x = 22
          </input>
        </program>
      </statement>
      <choices>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>x is 15 and y is 15</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
                    Look at the last assignment statement which gives x a different value.
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>x is 22 and y is 22</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
                    No, x and y are two separate variables.  Just because x changes in the last assignment statement, it does not change the value that was copied into y in the second statement.
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>x is 15 and y is 22</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
                    Look at the last assignment statement, which reassigns x, and not y.
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="yes">
          <statement>
            <p>x is 22 and y is 15</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
                    Yes, x has the value 22 and y the value 15.

    <title>Updating Variables</title>
  <!--<video xml:id="updatevid" youtube="Px1c-3GP-5o" width="auto"/>-->
  <p>One of the most common forms of reassignment is an <term>update</term> where the new
            value of the variable depends on the old.  For example,</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
x = x + 1
</input>
  </program>
  <p>This means get the current value of x, add one, and then update x with the new
            value.  The new value of x is the old value of x plus 1.  Although this assignment statement may
            look a bit strange, remember that executing assignment is a two-step process.  First, evaluate the
            right-hand side expression.  Second, let the variable name on the left-hand side refer to this new
            resulting object.  The fact that <c>x</c> appears on both sides does not matter.  The semantics of the assignment
            statement makes sure that there is no confusion as to the result.  The visualizer makes this very clear.</p>
  <exercise runestone="se_updatevar1"/>
  <program xml:id="ch2_sec11_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
x = 6        # initialize x
print(x)
x = x + 1    # update x
print(x)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>If you try to update a variable that doesn't exist, you get an error because
            Python evaluates the expression on the right side of the assignment operator
            before it assigns the resulting value to the name on the left.
            Before you can update a variable, you have to <term>initialize</term> it, usually with a
            simple assignment.  In the above example, <c>x</c> was initialized to 6.</p>
  <p>Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an <term>increment</term>; subtracting 1 is
            called a <term>decrement</term>.  Sometimes programmers also talk about <term>bumping</term>
            a variable, which means the same as incrementing it by 1.</p>
