  <title>Variables</title>
  <!--<video xml:id="assignvid" youtube="1uQM-TVlaMo" width="auto"/>-->
  <p>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to
            manipulate <term>variables</term>. A variable is a name that refers to a value.</p>
  <p>
    <term>Assignment statements</term> create new variables and also give them values to refer to.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
message = "What's up, Doc?"
n = 17
pi = 3.14159
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>This example makes three assignments. The first assigns the string value
    <c>"What's up, Doc?"</c> to a new variable named <c>message</c>. The second gives the
            integer <c>17</c> to <c>n</c>, and the third assigns the floating-point number
    <c>3.14159</c> to a variable called <c>pi</c>.
  </p>
  <p>The <term>assignment token</term>,    <c>=</c>, should not be confused with <em>equality</em> (we will see later that equality uses the
    <c>==</c> token).  The assignment statement links a <em>name</em>, on the left hand
            side of the operator, with a <em>value</em>, on the right hand side.  This is why you
            will get an error if you enter:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
17 = n
    </input>
  </program>
  <note>
    <p>When reading or writing code, say to yourself <q>n is assigned 17</q> or <q>n gets
                the value 17</q> or <q>n is a reference to the object 17</q> or <q>n refers to the object 17</q>.  Don't say <q>n equals 17</q>.
    </p>
  </note>
  <p>A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow
            pointing to the variable's value. This kind of figure, known as a <term>reference diagram</term>, is often called a <term>state
                snapshot</term> because it shows what state each of the variables is in at a
            particular instant in time.  (Think of it as the variable's state of mind).
            This diagram shows the result of executing the assignment statements shown above.</p>
  <image source="SimplePythonData/Figures/refdiagram1.png" width="50%" alt="Reference Diagram"/>
  <p>If you ask Python to evaluate a variable, it will produce the value
            that is currently linked to the variable.  In other words, evaluating a variable will give you the value that is referred to
            by the variable.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_variables_1" label="ac_variables_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
message = "What's up, Doc?"
n = 17
pi = 3.14159

print(message)
print(n)
print(pi)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>In each case the result is the value of the variable.
            To see this in even more detail, we can run the program using codelens.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_variables_2" label="ac_variables_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
          message = "What's up, Doc?"
          n = 17
          pi = 3.14159
          
          print(message)
          print(n)
          print(pi)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>Now, as you step through the statements, you can see
            the variables and the values they reference as those references are
            created.</p>
  <!-- <p>Variables also have
            types; again, we can ask the interpreter what they are.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch2_sec4_p2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
message = "What's up, Doc?"
n = 17
pi = 3.14159

print(type(message))
print(type(n))
print(type(pi))
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>The type of a variable is the type of the object it currently refers to.</p> -->
  <p>We use variables in a program to <q>remember</q> things, like the current score at
            the football game.  But variables are <em>variable</em>. This means they can change
            over time, just like the scoreboard at a football game.  You can assign a value
            to a variable, and later assign a different value to the same variable.</p>
  <note>
    <p>This is different from math. In math, if you give <title_reference>x</title_reference> the value 3, it
                cannot change to refer to a different value half-way through your
                calculations!</p>
  </note>
  <p>To see this, read and then run the following program.
            You'll notice we change the value of <title_reference>day</title_reference> three times, and on the third
            assignment we even give it a value that is of a different type.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_variables_3" label="ac_variables_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
          day = "Thursday"
          print(day)
          day = "Friday"
          print(day)
          day = 21
          print(day)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>A great deal of programming is about having the computer remember things.  For example, we might want to keep
            track of the number of missed calls on your phone.  Each time another call is missed, we will arrange to update
            or change the variable so that it will always reflect the correct value.</p>

  <title>Variable Names and Keywords</title>
  <p>
    <term>Variable names</term> can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and
            digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore. Although it is
            legal to use uppercase letters, by convention we don't. If you do, remember
            that case matters. <c>Bruce</c> and <c>bruce</c> are different variables.</p>
  <warning>
    <p>Variable names can never contain spaces.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>The underscore character ( <c>_</c>) can also appear in a name. It is often used in
            names with multiple words, such as <c>my_name</c> or <c>price_of_tea_in_china</c>.
            There are some situations in which names beginning with an underscore have
            special meaning, so a safe rule for beginners is to start all names with a
            letter.</p>
  <p>If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error.  In the example below, each
            of the variable names is illegal.</p>
  <pre>76trombones = "big parade"
more$ = 1000000
class = "Computer Science 101"</pre>
  <p>
    <c>76trombones</c> is illegal because it does not begin with a letter.  <c>more$</c>
            is illegal because it contains an illegal character, the dollar sign. But
            what's wrong with <c>class</c>?
  </p>
  <p>It turns out that <c>class</c> is one of the Python <term>keywords</term>. Keywords define
            the language's syntax rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable
            names.
            Python has thirty-something keywords (and every now and again improvements to
            Python introduce or eliminate one or two):</p>

  <p>You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one
            of your variable names and you don't know why, see if it is on this list.</p>
  <p>Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful to
            the human readers of the program &#x2014; they help the programmer document, or
            remember, what the variable is used for.</p>
  <warning>
    <p>Beginners sometimes confuse <q>meaningful to the human readers</q> with
      <q>meaningful to the computer</q>.  So they'll wrongly think that because
                they've called some variable <c>average</c> or <c>pi</c>, it will somehow
                automagically calculate an average, or automagically associate the variable
      <c>pi</c> with the value 3.14159.  No! The computer doesn't attach semantic
                meaning to your variable names.</p>
    <p>So you'll find some instructors who deliberately don't choose meaningful
                names when they teach beginners &#x2014; not because they don't think it is a
                good habit, but because they're trying to reinforce the message that you,
                the programmer, have to write some program code to calculate the average,
                or you must write an assignment statement to give a variable the value you
                want it to have.</p>
