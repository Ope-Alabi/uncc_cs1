  <title>Complex Logic Introduction</title>
  <p>Believe it or not, in the past seven weeks we've covered nearly all of the fundamental constructs within programming. 
  While there is certainly much more to learn and discover, virtually any programming language you will see in the future offers some form
  of branching, looping, and function definition. That is not to say we have mastered these topics yet. This week of class and this chapter
  focuses on revisiting these fundamental topics and deepening our mastery of them.</p>
