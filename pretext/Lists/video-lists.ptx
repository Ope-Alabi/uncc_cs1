  <title>Practice Video Lecture</title>
  <p>Our course mentor Ethan has generously put together short video lectures to culminate each weekly reading. Now that you have finished chapters 3 and 4, the video is embedded below. 
  It is not required, but you may find it helpful if the reading left you with questions.</p>
