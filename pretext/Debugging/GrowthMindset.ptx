  <title>Embracing the Journey</title>
  <p>As we wrap up this section that deals with handling errors and verifying our solutions work it is important to know that learning to code can be hard at times and sometimes frustrating. However, the feeling you get when your code works is incredible! And your brain grows as you problem solve and debug your programs. Embrace those moments. Pause and think of why things actually went from problematic to working and doing what you want it to do.</p>

<p>To practice using a growth mindset, if you find yourself saying or thinking what’s in the left column, try substituting what’s in the right column instead:

  <title>Debugging Tips</title>

<p>
  Here are some practical tips to help you effectively debug your code, avoid and overcome errors:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Make sure you take the time to understand error messages. They can help you a lot.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><c>print</c> statements are your friends.  Use them to help you uncover what is <term>really</term> happening in your code.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Work backward from the error.  Many times an error message is caused by something that has happened before it in the program.  Always remember that python evaluates a program top to bottom.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Simplify complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts.</li>
    <li>Don't hesitate to ask for help from peers, online communities, or mentors. A fresh perspective can often spot issues you might overlook.</li>
    <li>Take breaks if you feel frustrated. A clear mind can make problem-solving much easier.</li>
    <li>Each error is an opportunity to learn. Take note of what caused the error and how you resolved it for future reference. </li>
  
  </ul>
