    Programming is a complex process.
    Since it is done by human beings, errors may often occur.
    Programming errors are called <term>bugs</term> and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called <term>debugging</term>.
    <!-- fun story, but technically false in saying that's where the term came from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_(engineering) -->
    <!-- Some claim that in 1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one of the first computers at Harvard, and the term <term>bug</term> has remained in use since. -->

    Three kinds of errors can occur in a program:

    <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error">runtime errors</url>,
    and <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error">semantic errors</url>.
    It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.

      <ul>
          <li><p>Given a piece of code identify the Syntax errors based on error messages</p></li>
          <li><p>Given a piece of code find the ValueError, TypeError, SyntaxError, ParseError, and/or NameError</p></li>

    <statement><p>Debugging is:</p></statement>

        <statement><p>tracking down programming errors and correcting them.</p></statement>
        <feedback>
          Programming errors are called bugs and the process of finding and removing them from a program is called debugging.
        </feedback>

      <choice>
        <statement><p>removing all the bugs from your house.</p></statement>
        <feedback>
          Maybe, but that is not what we are talking about in this context.
        </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement><p>finding all the bugs in the program.</p></statement>
        <feedback>
          This is partially correct.  But, debugging is more than just finding the bugs.  What do you need to do once you find them?
        </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement><p>fixing the bugs in the program.</p></statement>
        <feedback>
          This is partially correct.  But, debugging is more than just fixing the bugs. What do you need to do before you can fix them?
