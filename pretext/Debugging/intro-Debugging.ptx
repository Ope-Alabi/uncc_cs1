    Programming is a complex process.
    Since it is done by human beings, errors may often occur.
    Programming errors are called <term>bugs</term> and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called <term>debugging</term>.
    <!-- fun story, but technically false in saying that's where the term came from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_(engineering) -->
    <!-- Some claim that in 1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one of the first computers at Harvard, and the term <term>bug</term> has remained in use since. -->

    Three kinds of errors can occur in a program:

    <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error">runtime errors</url>,
    and <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error">semantic errors</url>.
    It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.
