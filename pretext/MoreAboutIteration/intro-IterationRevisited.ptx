  <title>Iteration Revisited</title>
  <p xml:id="more-about-iteration_index-1">Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or
            similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and
            people do poorly.</p>
  <p>Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called <term>iteration</term>.  Because
            iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it
            easier. We've already seen the <c>for</c> statement in a previous chapter.  This is a very common
            form of iteration in Python. In this chapter
            we are going to look at the <c>while</c> statement &#x2014; another way to have your
            program do iteration.</p>
