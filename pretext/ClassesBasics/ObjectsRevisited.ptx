  <title>Objects Revisited</title>
  <p>In Python, every value is actually an object. Whether it be a string, a list, or even an integer, they are all objects.  Programs manipulate those objects either by performing
          computation with them or by asking them to perform methods.  To be more specific, we say that an object has
          a <term>state</term> and a collection of <term>methods</term> that it can perform.  The state of an object represents those things
          that the object knows about itself.  For example, each list has a state consisting
          of the items it contains, a length and so on.  Each list also has the ability to add, delete, and sort the items inside of it.  Individual lists are different in 
          that even though they are all lists, they differ in the specific values of the individual state attributes (maybe they have different items inside them).</p>
