    <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>We previously saw that each turtle instance has its own attributes and
            a number of methods that can be applied to the instance.  For example,
            we wrote <c>tess.right(90)</c> when we wanted the turtle object <c>tess</c> to perform the <c>right</c> method to turn
            to the right 90 degrees.  The <q>dot notation</q> is the way we connect the name of an object to the name of a method
            it can perform.</p>
  <p>Strings are also objects.  Each string instance has its own attributes and methods.  The most important attribute of the string is the collection of characters.  There are a wide variety of methods.  Try the following program.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp08_upper" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
ss = "Hello, World"
print(ss.upper())
=======
  <p>We previously used a few functions like <c>print()</c> and <c>len()</c> where we place the variable inside the parentheses such as <c>len(my_str)</c>. On the other hand, a <b>method</b> is a function that is attached to a specific Python object. 
    To access this function, we write the object, then a dot <c>.</c>, and then the name of the method.   The "dot notation" is the way we connect the name of an object to the name of a method
    it can perform. For example, we can write <c>my_str.upper()</c> when we want the string <c>my_str</c> to perform the <c>upper()</c> method to create an upper-case version of itself.</p>

  <p>Remember that strings are <term> immutable</term>. Therefore, all string methods give us a new string and must be assigned to a new variable. The original string is unchanged.</p>

  <program xml:id="ch3_sec5_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
my_str = "Hello, World"
my_str.upper()
print(my_str) # my_str is unchanged! 
print(my_str.upper()) #Gives us the new string, we can print it or assign it to a variable
my_new_str = my_str.upper()
print(my_new_str)
  </input>
  </program>
  <p>In this example, <c>upper</c> is a method that can be invoked on any string object
            to create a new string in which all the
            characters are in uppercase. </p>
  <p>In addition to <c>upper</c>, the following table provides some useful string methods.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="strings_string-format-method">
    <title>String Format Method</title>
    <p>In grade school quizzes a common convention is to use fill-in-the blanks. For instance,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hello _____!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and you can fill in the name of the person greeted, and combine
                given text with a chosen insertion. <em>We use this as an analogy:</em>
                Python has a similar
                construction, better called fill-in-the-braces. The string method <c>format</c>,  makes
                substitutions into places in a string
                enclosed in braces. Run this code:</p>
    <program xml:id="ch08_methods3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
person = input('Your name: ')
greeting = 'Hello {}!'.format(person)
print(greeting)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>There are several new ideas here!</p>
    <p>The string for the <c>format</c> method has a special form, with braces embedded.
                Such a string is called a <em>format string</em>.  Places where
                braces are embedded are replaced by the value of an expression
                taken from the parameter list for the <c>format</c> method. There are many
                variations on the syntax between the braces. In this case we use
                the syntax where the first (and only) location in the string with
                braces has a substitution made from the first (and only) parameter.</p>
    <p>In the code above, this new string is assigned to the identifier
                <c>greeting</c>, and then the string is printed.</p>
    <p>The identifier
                <c>greeting</c> was introduced to break the operations into a clearer
                sequence of steps. However, since the value of <c>greeting</c> is only
                referenced once, it can be eliminated with the more concise
                version:</p>
    <program xml:id="ch08_methods4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
person = input('Enter your name: ')
print('Hello {}!'.format(person))
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>There can be multiple substitutions, with data of any type.
                Next we use floats.  Try original price $2.50  with a 7% discount:</p>
    <program xml:id="ch08_methods5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
calculation = '${} discounted by {}% is ${}.'.format(origPrice, discount, newPrice)
print(calculation)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>The parameters are inserted into the braces in order.</p>
    <p>If you used the data suggested, this result is not satisfying.
                Prices should appear with exactly two places beyond the decimal point,
                but that is not the default way to display floats.</p>
    <p>Format strings can give further information inside the braces
                showing how to specially format data.
                In particular floats can be shown with a specific number of decimal places.
                For two decimal places, put <c>:.2f</c> inside the braces for the monetary values:</p>
    <program xml:id="ch08_methods6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
calculation = '${:.2f} discounted by {}% is ${:.2f}.'.format(origPrice, discount, newPrice)
print(calculation)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>The 2 in the format modifier can be replaced by another integer to round to that
                specified number of digits.</p>
    <p>This kind of format string depends directly on the order of the
                parameters to the format method. There are other approaches that we will
                skip here, explicitly numbering substitutions and taking substitutions from a dictionary.</p>
    <p>A technical point: Since braces have special meaning in a format
                string, there must be a special rule if you want braces to actually
                be included in the final <em>formatted</em> string. The rule is to double
                the braces: <c>{ {</c> and <c>}}</c>. For example mathematical set
                notation uses braces. The initial and final doubled
                braces in the format string below generate literal braces in the
                formatted string:</p>
    <pre>a = 5
b = 9
setStr =  'The set is {&#x200B;{ {},{} }&#x200B;}.'.format(a, b)
print(setStr)</pre>
    <p>Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the ActiveCode format implementation has a bug,
                printing doubled braces, but standard Python prints <c>{5, 9}</c>.</p>
    <p>You can have multiple placeholders indexing the same argument, or perhaps even have extra
                arguments that are not referenced at all:</p>
    <program xml:id="ch08_formatspecification" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
letter = """

 {0}, I have an interesting money-making proposition for you!
