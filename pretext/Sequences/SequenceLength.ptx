    <p>The <c>len</c> function, when applied to a string, returns the number of characters in a string.</p>
    <program xml:id="ac_5_5_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
            fruit = "Banana"
            print(len(fruit))

        </input>
    </program>
    <p>To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like this:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac_5_5_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
            fruit = "Banana"
            sz = len(fruit)
            last = fruit[sz]       # ERROR!
            print(last)

        </input>
    </program>

    <p>That won't work. It causes the runtime error <c>IndexError: string index out of range</c>. The reason is that there is no letter at index position 6 in <c>"Banana"</c>. Since we started counting at zero, the six indexes are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, we have to subtract 1 from the length.  Give it a try in the example above.</p>

    <program xml:id="ac_5_5_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
            fruit = "Banana"
            sz = len(fruit)
            lastch = fruit[sz-1]
            print(lastch)

        </input>
    </program>

    <p>
        Typically, a Python programmer would combine lines 2 and 3 from the above example into a single line:
    </p>
    <program language="python">
        <input>
            lastch = fruit[len(fruit)-1]
        </input>
    </program>

    <p>
        Though, from what you just learned about using negative indices, using <code>fruit[-1]</code> would be a more appropriate way to access the last index in a list.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can still use the <code>len</code> function to access other predictable indices, like the middle character of a string.
    </p>

    <program language="python">
        <input>
            fruit = "grape"
            midchar = fruit[len(fruit)//2]
            # the value of midchar is "a"
        </input>
    </program>

    <p>
        As with strings, the function <code>len</code> returns the length of a list (the number of items in the list). However, since lists can have items which are themselves sequences (e.g., strings), it important to note that len only returns the top-most length. 
    </p>

    <program xml:id="ac_5_5_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
            alist =  ["hello", 2.0, 5]
            print(len(alist))
            print(len(alist[0]))

        </input>
    </program>

    <p>
        Note that <code>alist[0]</code> is the string <code>"hello"</code>, which has length 5.
