      <p>An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter. The user of a
                            Python shell types commands at the prompt (&gt;&gt;&gt;), and presses the return
                            key to send these commands immediately to the interpreter for
                            processing.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>runtime error</title>
      <p>An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute
                            but that prevents the program from continuing.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>semantic error</title>

      <title>shell mode</title>
      <p>A style of using Python where we type expressions at the command
                            prompt, and the results are shown immediately.  Contrast with
                            <term>source code</term>, and see the entry under <term>Python shell</term>.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>source code</title>

    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>syntax error</title>
      <p>An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse &#x2014; and
                            therefore impossible to interpret.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>token</title>
      <p>One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program,
                            analogous to a word in a natural language.</p>
