  <title>Sequence conditional operators</title>
  <p>Along with basic comparsion operators, Python also provides built-in operators to create boolean expressions with sequences, such as strings and lists.</p>
  <p>The <c>in</c> operator tests if one string is a substring of another:</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_1" label="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print('p' in 'apple')
print('i' in 'apple')
print('ap' in 'apple')
print('pa' in 'apple')
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Note that a string is a substring of itself, and the empty string is a
            substring of any other string. (Also note that computer scientists
            like to think about these edge cases quite carefully!)</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_2" label="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print('a' in 'a')
print('apple' in 'apple')
print('' in 'a')
print('' in 'apple')
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The <c>not in</c> operator returns the logical opposite result of <c>in</c>.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_3" label="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print('x' not in 'apple')
print('a' not in 'apple')
        </input>
  </program>
  <subsection>
    <title>List Membership</title>
  <p><c>in</c> and <c>not in</c> are boolean operators that test membership in a sequence. We
            used them previously with strings and they also work here.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_4" label="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
fruit = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]

print("apple" in fruit)
print("pear" in fruit)
print("watermelon" not in fruit)
        </input>
  </program>

<p> Remember that <c>in</c> and <c>not in</c> only checks for membership in the top level of a list. </p>

  <program xml:id="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_5" label="ac_sequenceConditionalOperators_5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
my_list = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry", ["pear", "kiwi"]]
print("pear" in my_list) # prints False because "pear" is in a sublist
print("g" in my_list) # prints False because "g" is not an member in my_list by itself
print("orange" not in my_list) # prints False because "orange" is a member of my_list 
        </input>
