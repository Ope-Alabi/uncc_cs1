  <title>Chained conditionals</title>
  <p>Python provides an alternative way to write nested selection such as the one shown in the previous section.
            This is sometimes referred to as a <term>chained
                conditional</term>.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
if x &lt; y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x &gt; y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x and y must be equal")
</input>
  </program>
  <p>The flow of control can be drawn in a different orientation but the resulting pattern is identical to the one shown above.</p>
  <image source="Selection/Figures/flowchart_chained_conditional.png" width="50%"/>
  <p><c>elif</c> is an abbreviation of <c>else if</c>. Again, exactly one branch will be
            executed. There is no limit of the number of <c>elif</c> statements but only a
            single (and optional) final <c>else</c> statement is allowed and it must be the last
            branch in the statement.</p>
  <p>Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked,
            and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the
            statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true
            branch executes.</p>
  <p>Here is the same program using <c>elif</c>.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch5_sec5_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
x = 10
y = 10

if x &lt; y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x &gt; y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x and y must be equal")
        </input>
  </program>

                    No, III will not give the same result.  The first if statement will be true, but the second will be false, so the else part will execute.
