  <title>List Membership</title>
  <p><c>in</c> and <c>not in</c> are boolean operators that test membership in a sequence. We
            used them previously with strings and they also work here.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch5_sec7_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
fruit = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]

print("apple" in fruit)
print("pear" in fruit)
        </input>
  </program>

<p> Remember that <c>in</c> and <c>not in</c> only checks for membership in the top level of a list. </p>

  <program xml:id="ch5_sec7_p2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
my_list = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry", ["pear", "kiwi"]]
print("pear" in my_list) # prints False because "pear" is in a sublist
print("g" in my_list) # prints False because "g" is not an member in my_list by itself
        </input>
