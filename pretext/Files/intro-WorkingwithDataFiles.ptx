  <title>Working with Text Data</title>

  <p>
    Humans interpret text by understanding it within the context of language and communication. 
    In contrast, computers process text to extract meaningful insights, automating tasks 
    like spell-checking, text summarization, and building intelligent chatbots.</p>
<p>
  Throughout the first chapters of this book we have used strings to represent words or
   phrases that we wanted to print out. Our definition was simple: a string is simply some characters inside quotes.
   In this chapter we explore strings in much more detail as we see how we can bring in large amount of data into our programs.

  <p>So far, the data we have used in this book have all been either coded right into the program, or have been entered by the user.  In real life, data reside in files.</p>  
  <p>For example, web pages, word processing documents, and all data that live in files.  In this chapter we will introduce the Python concepts necessary to use data from files in our programs.</p>
  <p>For our purposes, we will assume that our data files are text files&#x2013;that is, files filled with characters. The Python programs that you write are stored as text files.  We can create these files in any of a number of ways. For example, we could use a text editor to type in and save the data.  We could also download the data from a website and then save it in a file. Regardless of how the file is created, Python will allow us to manipulate the contents.</p>
  <p>In Python, we must <term>open</term> files before we can use them and <term>close</term> them when we are done with them. As you might expect, once a file is opened it becomes a Python object just like all other data. <xref ref="files_files_filemethods1a"/> shows the functions and methods that can be used to open and close files.</p>
