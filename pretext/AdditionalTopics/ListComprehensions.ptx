  <title>List Comprehensions</title>
  <p>Generating or modifying a list of values based on some consistent rule is a very common operation done in Python. Take, for example, 
  generating a list of values according to a math function, or performing the same string operation on a list of words. This is common 
  enough that Python has built-in syntax to construct these smaller, collection-producing loops succinctly. These are known as <term>comprehensions</term>, 
  and can be done with several different collection types. </p>
  
  <p>A comprehension that generates a list is, naturally, known as a <term>list comprehension</term>.
  List comprehensions are concise ways to create lists.  The general syntax is:</p>
  <pre>[&lt;expression&gt; for &lt;item&gt; in &lt;sequence&gt; if &lt;condition&gt;]</pre>
  <p>where the if clause is optional.  For example,</p>
  <program xml:id="ch15_sec1_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]

yourlist = [item ** 2 for item in mylist]

print(yourlist)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The expression describes each element of the list that is being built.  The <c>for</c> clause iterates through each item in a sequence.  The items are filtered by the <c>if</c> clause if there is one.  In the example above, the <c>for</c> statement lets <c>item</c> take on all the values in the list <c>mylist</c>.  Each item is then squared before it is added to the list that is being built.  The result is a list of squares of the values in <c>mylist</c>.</p>
  <p>To write a <c>primes_upto</c> function we can use the previously-made <c>is_prime</c> function to filter the sequence of integers coming from a <c>range</c> function.  In other words, for every integer from 2 up to but not including <c>n</c>, if the integer is prime, keep it in the list.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
def primes_upto(n):
    """ Return a list of all prime numbers less than n using a list comprehension. """

    result = [num for num in range(2,n) if is_prime(num)]
    return result
</input>

      <p>What is printed by the following statements?</p>
      <program language="python">

        <feedback>
                    Items from alist are doubled before being placed in blist.

        <statement>
          <p>[8,4,16,12,10]</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    Not all the items in alist are to be included in blist.  Look at the if clause.

          <p>10</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    The result needs to be a list.

        <statement>
          <p>[10].</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    Yes, 5 is the only odd number in alist.  It is doubled before being placed in blist.
